If you still have problems with *this* library, the preferred way to get help is to join the [official group chat on Telegram](https://t.me/pythontelegrambotgroup).

Alternatively, you can also ask a question in the [Discussions section](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/discussions) on GitHub.

Finally, there is also a `python-telegram-bot` tag on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python-telegram-bot), though the development team of this library doesn't actively follow those questions.
