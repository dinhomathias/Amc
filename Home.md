## Structure of this Wiki

In the sidebar to the right, you can find all important pages of this wiki. They are roughly organized by the following logic:

### Must read

Introductory articles and frequently referenced pages.

### Concepts & Important Elements

Introductions & explanations of how the components of `telegram.ext` work and interact with each other.

### Notable Features

Elaborate explanation to more advanced features of `telegram.ext`.

### Code Resources

Some other resources that are not exclusively PTB-specific.

### Examples Explained

An effort to make the [examples](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/tree/master/examples) even more accessible.
*You are very welcome to extend this section!*

### Networking

Articles about advanced networking questions.

### Other resources

More interesting & helpful stuff that can't be found in any of the above sections.

### Transition Guides

Major versions usually come with breaking changes, i.e. changes that lead to code failing after upgrading. Those guides help to ease the transition.

### Administration

Interesting mostly for the maintainers. They, too, need a place to take notes 🙂
