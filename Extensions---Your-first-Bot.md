## Introduction
The `telegram.ext` submodule is built on top of the pure API implementation. It provides an easy-to-use interface and takes some work off the programmer, so you [don't have to repeat yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself).

It consists of several classes, but the most important one is [`telegram.ext.Application`](https://docs.python-telegram-bot.org/telegram.ext.application.html#telegram-ext-application).

The `Application` class is responsible for fetching updates from the `update_queue`, which is where the [`Updater`](https://docs.python-telegram-bot.org/telegram.ext.updater.html#telegram-ext-updater) class continuously fetches new updates from Telegram and adds them to this queue.
If you create an `Application` object, using [`ApplicationBuilder`](https://docs.python-telegram-bot.org/telegram.ext.applicationbuilder.html#telegram-ext-applicationbuilder), it will automatically create a `Updater` for you and link them together with an [`asyncio.Queue`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-queue.html#asyncio.Queue). 
You can then register handlers of different types in the `Application`, which will sort the updates fetched by the `Updater` according to the handlers you registered, and deliver them to a callback function that you defined.

Every handler is an instance of any subclass of the [`telegram.ext.BaseHandler`](https://docs.python-telegram-bot.org/telegram.ext.basehandler.html#telegram.ext.BaseHandler) class. The library provides [[handler classes for almost all use cases|Types-of-Handlers]], but if you need something very specific, you can also subclass `Handler` yourself.

To begin, you'll need an Access Token. If you have already read and followed [[Introduction to the API|Introduction-to-the-API]], you can use the one you generated then. If not: To generate an Access Token, you have to talk to [@BotFather](https://telegram.me/botfather) and follow a few simple steps (described [here](https://core.telegram.org/bots/features#botfather)). You should really read the introduction first, though.


## Your first Bot, step-by-step

Please create a new file if you want to follow this tutorial.
We will add new content to the file several times during the tutorial.
For the sake of brevity, we will not repeat everything every time we add something.

So, *let's get started!*.
Paste the following into your file:

```python
import logging
from telegram import Update
from telegram.ext import ApplicationBuilder, ContextTypes, CommandHandler

logging.basicConfig(
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
    level=logging.INFO
)

async def start(update: Update, context: ContextTypes.DEFAULT_TYPE):
    await context.bot.send_message(chat_id=update.effective_chat.id, text="I'm a bot, please talk to me!")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    application = ApplicationBuilder().token('TOKEN').build()
    
    start_handler = CommandHandler('start', start)
    application.add_handler(start_handler)
    
    application.run_polling()
```

Now this is a lot to digest, so let's go through it step by step.

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
    level=logging.INFO
)
```

This part is for setting up `logging` module, so you will know when (and why) things don't work as expected:

**Note:** Read the article on [[Exceptions, Warnings and Logging|Exceptions,-Warnings-and-Logging]] if you want to learn more.

```python
application = ApplicationBuilder().token('TOKEN').build()
```

Here the first real magic happens: You have to create an `Application` object. Replace `'TOKEN'` with your Bot's API token.
For more details on how this works, see [[this page|Builder-Pattern]].

**Related docs:** [`telegram.ext.ApplicationBuilder`](https://docs.python-telegram-bot.org/telegram.ext.applicationbuilder.html#telegram-ext-applicationbuilder), [`telegram.ext.Application`](https://docs.python-telegram-bot.org/telegram.ext.application.html#telegram.ext.Application)

The application alone doesn't do anything.
To add functionality, we do two things.
First, we define a function that should process a specific type of update:

```python
async def start(update: Update, context: ContextTypes.DEFAULT_TYPE):
    await context.bot.send_message(
        chat_id=update.effective_chat.id,
        text="I'm a bot, please talk to me!"
    )
```


The goal is to have this function called every time the Bot receives a Telegram message that contains the `/start` command. 

As you can see, this function will receive two parameters: an `update`, which is an object that contains all the information and data that are coming from telegram itself (like the message, the user who issued the command, etc) and a `context`, which is another object that contains information and data about the status of the library itself (like the `Bot`, the `Application`, the `job_queue`, etc).

**Related docs:** [`send_message`](https://docs.python-telegram-bot.org/telegram.bot.html#telegram.Bot.send_message), [`telegram.ext.CallbackContext` (the type of the context argument)](https://docs.python-telegram-bot.org/telegram.ext.callbackcontext.html), [`telegram.Update` (the type of update argument)](https://docs.python-telegram-bot.org/telegram.update.html)

To tell your bot to listen to `/start` commands, you can use a `CommandHandler` (one of the provided `Handler` subclasses) and register it in the application:

```python
from telegram.ext import CommandHandler
start_handler = CommandHandler('start', start)
application.add_handler(start_handler)
```

**Related docs:** [`telegram.ext.CommandHandler`](http://docs.python-telegram-bot.org/telegram.ext.commandhandler.html), [`telegram.ext.Application.add_handler`](http://docs.python-telegram-bot.org/telegram.ext.application.html#telegram.ext.Application.add_handler)

And that's all you need.

Finally, the line `application.run_polling()` runs the bot until you hit `CTRL+C`.

**Related docs:** [`telegram.ext.Application.run_polling`](http://docs.python-telegram-bot.org/telegram.ext.application.html#telegram.ext.Application.run_polling)

Give it a try! Start a chat with your bot and issue the `/start` command - if all went right, it will reply.

But our Bot can now only answer to the `/start` command.
Let's add another handler that listens for regular messages. Use the `MessageHandler`, another `Handler` subclass, to echo all text messages.
First stop your bot by hitting `CTRL+C`.
Now define a new function and add a corresponding handler:

```python
from telegram import Update
from telegram.ext import filters, MessageHandler, ApplicationBuilder, CommandHandler, ContextTypes

...

async def echo(update: Update, context: ContextTypes.DEFAULT_TYPE):
    await context.bot.send_message(chat_id=update.effective_chat.id, text=update.message.text)

    
if __name__ == '__main__':
    ...
    echo_handler = MessageHandler(filters.TEXT & (~filters.COMMAND), echo)
    
    application.add_handler(start_handler)
    application.add_handler(echo_handler)

    application.run_polling()
```
**Related docs:** [`telegram.ext.MessageHandler`](http://docs.python-telegram-bot.org/telegram.ext.messagehandler.html), [`telegram.ext.filters`](https://docs.python-telegram-bot.org/telegram.ext.filters.html)

From now on, your bot should echo all non-command messages it receives.

**Note:** The `filters` module contains a number of so-called filters that filter incoming messages for text, images, status updates and more. Any message that returns `True` for at least one of the filters passed to `MessageHandler` will be accepted. You can also write your own filters if you want. See more in [[Advanced Filters|Extensions---Advanced-Filters]].

Let's add some actual functionality to your bot. We want to implement a `/caps` command that will take some text as an argument and reply to it in CAPS. To make things easy, you can receive the arguments (as a `list`, split on spaces) that were passed to a command in the callback function:

```python
async def caps(update: Update, context: ContextTypes.DEFAULT_TYPE):
    text_caps = ' '.join(context.args).upper()
    await context.bot.send_message(chat_id=update.effective_chat.id, text=text_caps)
    
if __name__ == '__main__':
    ...
    caps_handler = CommandHandler('caps', caps)
    
    application.add_handler(start_handler)
    application.add_handler(echo_handler)
    application.add_handler(caps_handler)

    application.run_polling()
```

**Note:** Take a look at the usage of [`context.args`](https://docs.python-telegram-bot.org/telegram.ext.callbackcontext.html#telegram.ext.CallbackContext.args). The `CallbackContext` will have several attributes, depending on which handler is used.

Another cool feature of the Telegram Bot API is the [inline mode](https://core.telegram.org/bots/inline). If you want to implement inline functionality for your bot, please first talk to [@BotFather](https://telegram.me/botfather) and enable inline mode using `/setinline`. It sometimes takes a while until your Bot registers as an inline bot on your client. You might be able to speed up the process by restarting your Telegram App (or sometimes, you just have to wait for a while).

As your bot is obviously a very loud one, let's continue with this theme for inline. You probably know the process by now, but there are a number of new types used here, so pay some attention:

```python
from telegram import InlineQueryResultArticle, InputTextMessageContent
from telegram.ext import InlineQueryHandler

...

async def inline_caps(update: Update, context: ContextTypes.DEFAULT_TYPE):
    query = update.inline_query.query
    if not query:
        return
    results = []
    results.append(
        InlineQueryResultArticle(
            id=query.upper(),
            title='Caps',
            input_message_content=InputTextMessageContent(query.upper())
        )
    )
    await context.bot.answer_inline_query(update.inline_query.id, results)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    ...
    inline_caps_handler = InlineQueryHandler(inline_caps)
    application.add_handler(inline_caps_handler)

    application.run_polling()
```
**Related docs:** [telegram.ext.InlineQueryHandler](http://docs.python-telegram-bot.org/telegram.ext.inlinequeryhandler.html), [answer_inline_query](https://docs.python-telegram-bot.org/telegram.bot.html#telegram.Bot.answer_inline_query)

Not bad! Your Bot can now yell on command (ha!) and via inline mode. 

Some confused users might try to send commands to the bot that it doesn't understand, so you can use a `MessageHandler` with a `COMMAND` filter to reply to all commands that were not recognized by the previous handlers. 

```python
...

async def unknown(update: Update, context: ContextTypes.DEFAULT_TYPE):
    await context.bot.send_message(chat_id=update.effective_chat.id, text="Sorry, I didn't understand that command.")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    ...
    
    # Other handlers
    unknown_handler = MessageHandler(filters.COMMAND, unknown)
    application.add_handler(unknown_handler)

    application.run_polling()
```

**Note:** This handler *must* be added last.
If you added it before the other handlers, it would be triggered before the `CommandHandlers` had a chance to look at the update.
Once an update is handled, all further handlers are ignored.
To circumvent this, you can pass the keyword argument `group (int)` to `add_handler` with a value other than 0.
See [`telegram.ext.Application.add_handler`](https://docs.python-telegram-bot.org/telegram.ext.application.html#telegram.ext.Application.add_handler) and [[this wiki page|Frequently-requested-design-patterns#how-to-handle-updates-in-several-handlers]] for details.

If you're done playing around, stop the bot by pressing `CTRL+C`.
